docbook-to-man
    my customized version of the docbook-to-man script. Note that it has
    paths in it that you may need to change.
    I also used the PROLOG stuff to specify the DocBook DTD when passing
    the man pages to instant.

docbook-to-man.ts
    my customized version of the instant 'translation spec'.
    I added support for the central title at the top of the pages, and the
    revision date at the end. I also converted section 1 headings to all caps.
